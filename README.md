You are provided a list of cities and their latitude and longitudes as data for your program.
These are in latlong.csv
The file is comma-delimited, its first row is headers
The columns are:
City, Latitude, Longitude, State/Province, Country
This template project includes code to load the data for you.

Write code that accepts a list of city names and using the provided formulas and city lat long data returns the two cities that are closest together.

The class <code>com.ssnc.tests.latlong.DistanceService</code> is provided as a template to use, your implementation goes in <code>findClosestCities</code>.

1.  latitudinal and longitudal coordinates are in degrees, convert these to radians with  L * &pi; / 180
2.  Use the Vincenty formula to calculate the distance:

 N.B.: &phi; is latitude and &lambda; is longitude!  They are in the reverse order than 
 you may expect in the formula.

3.  It is an error if, for example, a provided city name does not exist in the lat long list.
    then throw a LatLongException. this is not the only possible error.

4.  You may need to make some assumptions, try to make these explicit.

5.  If you can write unit tests please include them in your submission!
